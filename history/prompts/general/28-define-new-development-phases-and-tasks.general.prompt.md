## Prompt
phase 7: user story 5 (personalized Dashboard 20tasks)

phase 8 : polish & deployment    14 tasks
## Response snapshot
I have created new specification and task files for "Personalized Dashboard" (Phase 7) and "Polish & Deployment" (Phase 8).
## Outcome
- ✅ Impact: Established initial specifications and task lists for two new development phases: Personalized Dashboard and Polish & Deployment.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created 4 new files (2 spec and 2 task files).
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user might provide more details for the tasks within each phase or request further action on these new phases.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully interpreted a high-level request for new development phases and translated it into structured spec and task documents according to the project's SDD workflow.
