# Personalized Dashboard Specification

## User Story
As a user, I want a personalized dashboard so that I can easily access relevant information and features.

## Requirements
- The dashboard should display information tailored to the logged-in user.
- It should provide quick access to frequently used features.
- The design should be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Out of Scope
- Real-time updates (for now).
- Complex customization options (beyond basic layout).

## Open Questions
- What specific information should be displayed on the dashboard?
- Which features should be prioritized for quick access?
- How will user personalization preferences be stored?
