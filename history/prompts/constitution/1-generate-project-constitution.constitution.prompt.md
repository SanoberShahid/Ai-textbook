# Prompt

Generate full constitution.

# Response

I have generated the project constitution and saved it in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

The constitution outlines the project's vision, core principles (Simplicity, Accuracy, Minimalism, Fast Builds, Free-Tier Architecture, and RAG answers ONLY from book text), mandates, key features, and architecture.
