## Prompt
phase 4:user story 2 (RAG Chatbot - 0/18 tasks)
## Response snapshot
Successfully updated the todo list. The current list is now:
1. [pending] Define the architecture and choose appropriate RAG components (e.g., embedding model, vector store, LLM).
2. [pending] Set up the development environment and necessary dependencies.
3. [pending] Implement data ingestion and chunking for the textbook content.
4. [pending] Generate embeddings for the chunked data.
5. [pending] Store embeddings in a vector database.
6. [pending] Develop the retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant chunks based on user queries.
7. [pending] Integrate with a Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation.
8. [pending] Build the chatbot interface (can be a simple CLI or integrate with the existing Docusaurus setup).
## Outcome
- ✅ Impact: Initiated the specification process for the RAG Chatbot feature and outlined initial tasks.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run or added in this step.
- 📁 Files: A new PHR file was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next steps involve defining the RAG architecture and setting up the development environment.
- 🧠 Reflection: The PHR was successfully created to document the initiation of the RAG Chatbot feature. The todo list provides a clear roadmap for the next steps.
