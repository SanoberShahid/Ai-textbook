  I have completed the requested changes and updated the todo list. I will now create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.
  The backend implementation for the RAG chatbot is now logically sound, with defined prompts for explanation and question-answering, and proper integration with Qdrant for embeddings and retrieval.
outcome: The backend has been strengthened by defining critical AI prompts and verifying the logging configuration, enabling the RAG chatbot to answer questions and utilize Qdrant embeddings effectively.
